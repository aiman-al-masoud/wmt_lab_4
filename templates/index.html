    <h1>The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</h1> 
    <h2>Story of the Door</h2> 
    <p> 
    Mr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that 
    was never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in 
    discourse; backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and 
    yet somehow lovable. 
    </p> 
    <p> 
    At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste, 
    something eminently human beaconed from his eye; something 
    indeed which never found its way into his talk, but which spoke 
    not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but 
    more often and loudly in the acts of his life. 
    </p>
